Team #24, University of Dundee, Haggis Aerospace

prefered cruise speed - 20 m/s or 40 knots

We couldnt make our plane tilt the wing and motors in xplane, so we ask that you carry out all the tests as a fixed wing.
We left the rear motor on the plane to simulate drag, however for it to not activate, please in joystick setup change 
"throtle" to "horizontal throtle. The wing may look flat but it should funtion as the designed airfoil.

thank you and good luck
